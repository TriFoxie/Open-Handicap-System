<h1>Open Handicap System</h1>
<p>A simple solution to track your played rounds and provide a handicap, using the same methods as the World Handicap System.</p>
<h2>Calculations</h2>
<p>For each game you play, a handicap is calculated using that course's difficulty rating, the slope rating, and your score.</p>
<p>It uses this equation: <b>(score - difficulty) X 113 / slope.</b></p>
<p>Your overall handicap is then taken from a mean average of your best 8 scores from your last 20 rounds.</p>
